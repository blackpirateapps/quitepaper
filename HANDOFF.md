# Quiet Paper — Engineering Handoff Document

Welcome to **Quiet Paper**! This repository is an offline-first notes application inspired by the calm, distraction-free writing experience of Bear Notes and iA Writer, equipped with zero-knowledge end-to-end encrypted cloud synchronization.

> [!NOTE]
> The engineering handoff documentation has been organized into modular, domain-specific guides and versioned logs located in the **[`handoff/`](handoff/)** directory. 
> A complete, verbatim backup of the original 11,433-line document is preserved at [`handoff/backup/HANDOFF.original.md`](handoff/backup/HANDOFF.original.md).

## 1. Documentation Index & Modular Guides

All documentation is partitioned for fast, targeted access by engineers and AI agents:

| Guide / Document | Description & Key Topics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[handoff/INDEX.md](handoff/INDEX.md)** | Master handoff directory, file map, and complete architectural overview. |
| **[handoff/core-architecture.md](handoff/core-architecture.md)** | Product vision, directory layout, crypto fundamentals, development commands, and security invariants (Sections 1–9). |
| **[handoff/sync-and-storage.md](handoff/sync-and-storage.md)** | Zero-knowledge E2EE (Argon2id + XChaCha20-Poly1305), Turso edge database, 3-way conflict merge engine, offline queue, and Drift SQLite persistence. |
| **[handoff/editor-and-typography.md](handoff/editor-and-typography.md)** | SuperEditor visual AST, editorial blockquotes with 3.5px accent bar & Enter continuation, LaTeX math syntax support (block formulas & Bear-style inline folding), smart todolist (optical alignment, auto-sort, collapsible done items), native code blocks with syntax highlighting, typewriter scrolling, and typography engine. |
| **[handoff/ocr-and-documents.md](handoff/ocr-and-documents.md)** | Scanned documents (`qp://document/<UUID>`), Syncfusion PDF viewer, Google ML Kit OCR, and desktop Ollama DeepSeek-OCR. |
| **[handoff/journal-and-audio.md](handoff/journal-and-audio.md)** | Daily journal, paper calendar archive, YAML frontmatter properties, audio voice memos, on-device transcription, and web clipper. |
| **[handoff/tags-and-search.md](handoff/tags-and-search.md)** | Nested tag hierarchy (`#parent/child`), Pure Bear List editorial aesthetic redesign (Sections 247 & 249), tag sync idempotency, universal fuzzy search & relevance ranking. |
| **[handoff/platform-and-builds.md](handoff/platform-and-builds.md)** | Multi-platform targets (Android, Linux, iOS, Desktop), CI/CD pipelines, automated build numbers, Linux packaging (DEB, RPM, AppImage, Flatpak), Linux native file sharing (`shareXFiles`), and first-run onboarding. |
| **[handoff/latest-logs.md](handoff/latest-logs.md)** | **Active engineering logs** for **v1.6.0+ (October 2026 – Present)**. New handoff entries should be appended here. |
| **[handoff/archive/logs-v1.5.md](handoff/archive/logs-v1.5.md)** | Historical engineering logs for **v1.5.0 through v1.5.9**. |
| **[handoff/archive/logs-v1.0-v1.4.md](handoff/archive/logs-v1.0-v1.4.md)** | Historical engineering logs for **v1.0.0 through v1.4.x**. |
| **[handoff/backup/HANDOFF.original.md](handoff/backup/HANDOFF.original.md)** | Unmodified, bit-for-bit verbatim backup of the pre-modularization document. |

## 2. Quick Architectural Reference

### Core Principles
- **Zero-Knowledge Encryption**: Note titles, bodies, tags, and document contents are encrypted client-side using `Argon2id` (19MB, 2 iterations, 16-byte salt) and `XChaCha20-Poly1305`. The cloud backend (Turso libSQL on Vercel) is crypto-blind and holds zero keys.
- **Offline-First Persistence**: Local SQLite via Drift (`AppDatabase`) is canonical on-device. Mutations queue in `SyncQueueTable` when offline and push automatically upon reconnect.
- **Visual Editor AST Source of Truth**: The visual editor (`SuperEditor`) uses an in-memory RichDocument AST as the source of truth, enabling zero-compilation autosaves without repeated markdown serialization.
- **Non-Destructive Storage**: Original PDFs, scanned documents, and web clipper HTML snapshots remain immutable in the encrypted vault.

### Core Testing & Development Commands
```bash
# Run Flutter unit and widget tests
flutter test

# Run Flutter static analysis
flutter analyze

# Regenerate Drift database and Riverpod models
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Run backend tests (TypeScript / Vitest)
cd backend && npm test
```

## 3. Instructions for Future AI Agents

In accordance with [`AGENTS.md`](file:///home/dog/git/quitepaper/AGENTS.md):
1. **Always consult relevant domain guides** in [`handoff/`](handoff/) before implementing changes to avoid breaking established subsystem architecture.
2. **Log new engineering work**:
   - Append detailed entries to **[`handoff/latest-logs.md`](handoff/latest-logs.md)**.
   - Include: numbered section, motivation, architectural design, modified files, and test verification results.
3. **Keep domain guides updated**: If introducing a new architectural pattern or subsystem, update the corresponding file in [`handoff/`](handoff/).
